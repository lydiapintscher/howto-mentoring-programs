= Let me teach you how to fish or: how to run a successful Free Software mentoring program

== Abstract

* mentoring is great
* why you should make it happen
* how you can make it happen

== 2 kinds of mentoring

* dedicated
* as you go

== 3 rocking programs

* GSoC
* SoK
* Code-in

== Why should you do it?

* gain new contributors
* new enthusiasm in your project
* new ideas
* get stuff done you wouldn't otherwise get to
* teach the ideas behind software freedom
*  publicity for your project
* focus in your project on making it more friendly and easier to get involved in for everyone -> mindset change that benefits everyone
* programs like this give structure to new contributors and make them not give up immediately when things get tough

== What you need

* good mentors (preferably long-term contributors)
* good admin
* publicity
* interesting tasks with timeline, goals and defined end
* incentive -> money, tshirt, fame, university credit, ..., right to contribute to your project
* start small!

== What you should be aware of

* students submitting their applications/evaluations late
* students trying to trick you
* students promising more than they can possibly deliver
* busy mentors -> only 1 student in first year because of underestimating of time and energy needed -> have back-up plans -> make it clear to students who to go to in case of problems with their mentor
* urge to accept a lot of students
* urge to revive dying subteams
* urge to accept a lot of oldies as a safe bet/known evil -> risk of losing them/them screwing up
* long-term contributors dropping out due to incentive change -> also win a lot of new ones
* wrong incentives?
* intimidation - big names they've admired for years -> encourage to apply -> we're loosing out on brilliant students -> encouragement matters a lot
* students being too selfconcious about their accomplishments
* incommunicative students
* don't let them hide behind their mentor -> need to get them into the community
* document your processes!

== How do you keep your students?

* show them that you are a great community
* give them exciting tasks
* give them publicity and praise their contribution
* keep them busy for at least a month after your program -> those still active then are most likely to stick with your project for longer
* make it clear that you expect students from previous years to mentor in the next years

== Success stories


== Go out and do it!
